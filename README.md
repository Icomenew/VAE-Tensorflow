# Variational Autoencoder in Tensorflow

This is an [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) implementation of a variational autoencoder for the deep learning course at USC ([CSCI-599 Deep Learning and its Applications](https://csci599-dl.github.io/)) taught by [Professor Joseph Lim](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~limjj/). The slides of this lecture are available [here](#). This demo code is written by [Shao-Hua Sun](http://shaohua0116.github.io).
